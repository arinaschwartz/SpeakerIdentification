Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took 
his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.
Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, 
"Where is Osama bin Laden? " He said, "I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. 
I'm not that concerned. "
We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.

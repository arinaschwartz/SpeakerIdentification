To listen to them.
To stand up straight and not scowl.
I love the strong women around me. I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.
I am -- you know it's really interesting. I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked 
Laura to marry me, she said, "Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. "I said, "OK, 
you've got a deal. "Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal. And she's out campaigning 
along with our girls. And she speaks English a lot better than I do. I think people understand 
what she's saying.
But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush. I can't tell you how lucky 
I am. When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the 
classic backyard barbecue. O'Neill said, "Come on over. I think you'll find somebody who might 
interest you. "So I said all right. Bopped over there. There was only four of us there. And not 
only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.

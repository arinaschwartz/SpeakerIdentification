Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of 
one of those exaggerations.
Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're 
using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.
My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a 
matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.

I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United 
States Senate for 20 years? He has no record on reforming of health care. No record at all.
He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.
No record of leadership.
I came to Washington to solve problems. I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose 
between prescription drugs and food. And so I led. And in 2006, our seniors will get a 
prescription drug coverage in Medicare.

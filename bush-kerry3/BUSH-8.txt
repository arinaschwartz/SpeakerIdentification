Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they 
voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.
He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American 
politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that 
Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.

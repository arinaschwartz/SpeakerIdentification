Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for 
the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was 
contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our 
country. We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the 
vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.
My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot 
this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.
The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is 
allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.
I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are 
most vulnerable get treated.
We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are 
worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.
One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of 
producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting 
sued in a court of law.
But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is 
for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.

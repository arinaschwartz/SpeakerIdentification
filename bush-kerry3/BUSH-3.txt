I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan 
is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.
He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and 
congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed 
up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.
It's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch.

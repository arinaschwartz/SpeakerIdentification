I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a 
society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in 
which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great 
differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put 
good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.
Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both 
political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that 
practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against 
that law.
What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are 
ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws 
-- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I 
will continue to promote abstinence programs.
The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I 
appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable 
alternative to abortion.

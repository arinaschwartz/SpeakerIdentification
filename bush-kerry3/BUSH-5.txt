Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.
He been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce 
taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally 
sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost 
the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion.
He talks about PAYGO. I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, 
when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.
He's proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is 
also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- 
billion, $800 billion by his account.
There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class.
I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's 
how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies 
that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.

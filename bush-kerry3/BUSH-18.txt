Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 
11th shows he doesn't know the borders. They're much better protected today than they were when 
I was the governor of Texas.
We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.
He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous 
claim.
And we'll continue to protect our borders. We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.
